Tasks
================

- limit: unbound group hierarchy
  - unbound and bastion are hard coded
  - proj1 etc. are free as long as this limit
- limit: zero or single limit tag
- design: bastion, not localhost
  - awx can't do sudo on tower host
  - set all and delegate to exploit --limit
- todo: don't start my-unbound always
- deploy playbook
  - todo: instead, test start and commit for fast startup
  - todo: install bind-utils on tower
  - todo: exclusive control for git repo and container
- todo: not git private key, do it inprior by yourself
